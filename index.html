            The orbit around this specific point in space will ensure that the telescope remains in the same relative
            position to the sun and the earth, so that the telescope remains unaffected by the heat and light.

            Arianespace to match up most telecommunications satellites for highly efficient
            dual launches – a capability that has been proven by the company in Ariane-series

            From the 18 hexagonal primary mirror segments, to the perfectly circular secondary mirror,
            and even the slightly trapezoidal tertiary mirror and the intricate fine-steering mirror,
            each reflector went through a rigorous refinement process before it was ready to mount on the telescope.
            This flawless formation process was critical for Webb, which will use the mirrors to peer far back in time to capture the light from the first stars and galaxies.

            and by the possibility that Webb’s components will degrade over time in the harsh environment of space.

            Hubble team members aim to keep the telescope going through,
            so its operations will overlap with those of NASA's James Webb Space Telescope (JWST),

            while Hubble sees more in the visible and ultraviolet wavelengths.
            Using both space telescopes in tandem "really gives you a more panchromatic view of the universe than you would get just from Hubble alone,
            or just from Webb alone,".

            JAMES WEBB SPACE TELESCOPE
        </div>
        <div class="about-fact-text">
            The James Webb Space Telescope (sometimes called JWST or Webb) is an orbiting infrared observatory that will
            complement and extend the discoveries of the Hubble Space Telescope, with longer wavelength coverage
            and greatly improved sensitivity. The longer wavelengths enable Webb to look much closer to the beginning
            of time and to hunt for the unobserved formation of the first galaxies, as well as to look inside dust clouds
            where stars and planetary systems are forming today.

            Black Hole for Taxpayer Money?
        </div>
        <div class="budget-fact-text">
            At first, the project was estimated to cost only $500 million,
            but extensive revaluation pushed the completion date back and the price tag up.
            Today, the James Webb Space Telescope’s budget exceeds $10 billion,
            and the project has essentially eaten astronomy. Despite its bloated budget,
            NASA has failed to launch this replacement in the 20-plus years since President George H. W. Bush left office.
            Receently news came out that the JWST will remain on Earth until at least 2022.

            The James Webb Space Telescope includes four scientific instruments:
        </div>
        <ul>
            <li id="camera" class="instruments">
                the Near Infrared Camera (NIRCam)
            </li>
            <li class="instruments" id="spectr">
                the Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec)
            </li>
            <li class="instruments" id="instrument">
                the Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI)
            </li>
            <li class="intruments" id="sensor">
                and the Fine Guidance Sensor/Near InfraRed Imager and Slitless Spectrograph (FGS-NIRISS)
            </li>
        </ul>
        <div class="instruments-list-text">
            <div id="camera-text">
                The Near Infrared Camera (NIRCam) is Webb's primary imager that will cover the infrared wavelength range 0.6 to 5 microns.
                NIRCam will detect light from: the earliest stars and galaxies in the process of formation,
                the population of stars in nearby galaxies, as well as young stars in the Milky Way and Kuiper Belt objects.
                NIRCam is equipped with coronagraphs, instruments that allow astronomers to take pictures of very faint objects around a central bright object,
                like stellar systems. NIRCam's coronagraphs work by blocking a brighter object's light,
                making it possible to view the dimmer object nearby.
                With the coronagraphs, astronomers hope to determine the characteristics of planets orbiting nearby stars.

            <div id="spectr-text">
                The Near InfraRed Spectrograph (NIRSpec) will operate over a wavelength range of 0.6 to 5 microns.
                A spectrograph (also sometimes called a spectrometer) is used to disperse light from an object into a spectrum.
                Analyzing the spectrum of an object can tell us about its physical properties, including temperature,
                mass, and chemical composition. The atoms and molecules in the object actually imprint lines on its spectrum
                that uniquely fingerprint each chemical element present and can reveal a wealth of information about physical conditions in the object.
            </div>
            <div id="instrument-text">
                The Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) has both a camera and a spectrograph that sees light
                in the mid-infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum,
                with wavelengths that are longer than our eyes see.
                MIRI covers the wavelength range of 5 to 28 microns.
                Its sensitive detectors will allow it to see the redshifted light of distant galaxies,
                newly forming stars, and faintly visible comets as well as objects in the Kuiper Belt.
                MIRI's camera will provide wide-field,
                broadband imaging that will continue the breathtaking astrophotography that has made Hubble so universally admired.

            <div id="sensor-text">
                The Fine Guidance Sensor (FGS) allows Webb to point precisely,
                so that it can obtain high-quality images. The Near Infrared Imager
                and Slitless Spectrograph part of the FGS/NIRISS will be used to
                investigate the following science objectives: first light detection,
                exoplanet detection and characterization, and exoplanet transit spectroscopy.
                FGS/NIRISS has a wavelength range of 0.8 to 5.0 microns,
                and is a specialized instrument with three main modes,
                each of which addresses a separate wavelength range.
                FGS is a "guider," which helps point the telescope.
